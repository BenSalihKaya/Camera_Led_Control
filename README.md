Description:
This project demonstrates real-time image processing using the OpenCV library in Python. The program captures video frames from a webcam and performs various image processing operations in real-time. Additionally, it includes an LED control feature that synchronizes the image processing results with the lighting of an external LED.

Features:
1. Webcam Video Capture: The program accesses the webcam and captures video frames for further processing.

2. Real-time Image Processing: Using OpenCV, the project applies various image processing techniques to the captured video frames, such as image filtering, edge detection, object recognition, or any other custom image processing algorithm.

3. LED Control: The project incorporates an external LED that can be controlled based on the results of the image processing. For example, the LED can change its intensity, color, or blink pattern based on specific features detected in the video frames.

4. Configurable Parameters: The program allows users to configure parameters such as image processing algorithms, LED control settings, and video resolution to customize the project according to their needs.

5. User Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface that displays the live video stream, processed video frames, and controls to adjust the parameters and LED settings.

Installation and Usage:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Connect a compatible webcam to your computer.
4. Run the Python script to launch the application.
5. Adjust the parameters and observe the real-time image processing results on the user interface.
6. Observe the synchronized LED control based on the processed video frames.
