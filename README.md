Requirements:
- Arduino Board: Any Arduino board can be used for this project, such as Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, or Arduino Mega.

- Python IDE: You will need a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to run the Python script. PyCharm, Anaconda, or any other Python IDE of your choice can be used.

- 5 LEDs: You will need 5 LEDs for the LED control part of the project. Make sure you have the necessary resistors and jumper wires to connect the LEDs to the Arduino board.

- Camera: A camera is required for capturing video frames. You can use your computer's built-in camera or connect an external USB camera to your computer.

- USB Cable: To connect the Arduino board to your computer, you will need a USB cable compatible with your Arduino board.

- Arduino Software: Install the Arduino software (IDE) on your computer to upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.

- Python Libraries:You can use pip, Anaconda, or any other package manager to install the required libraries.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary drivers installed for your camera and Arduino board to ensure proper communication and functionality.

Installation and Usage steps mentioned earlier in the project description provide guidance on setting up and running the project using the aforementioned requirements.



Description:
This project demonstrates real-time image processing using the OpenCV library in Python, along with Arduino integration for serial communication. The program captures video frames from a webcam, performs image processing operations in real-time, and synchronizes the results with the lighting of an external LED controlled by an Arduino board.

Features:
1. Webcam Video Capture: The program accesses the webcam and captures video frames for further processing.

2. Real-time Image Processing: Using OpenCV, the project applies various image processing techniques to the captured video frames, such as image filtering, edge detection, object recognition, or any other custom image processing algorithm.

3. LED Control with Arduino: The project incorporates an Arduino board connected to the computer via a serial port. The processed video frames trigger commands sent to the Arduino, which controls the lighting of an external LED. For example, the LED can change its intensity, color, or blink pattern based on specific features detected in the video frames.

4. Configurable Parameters: The program allows users to configure parameters such as image processing algorithms, LED control settings, video resolution, and Arduino communication settings to customize the project according to their needs.

5. User Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface that displays the live video stream, processed video frames, and controls to adjust the parameters, LED settings, and Arduino communication.

Installation and Usage:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Connect a compatible webcam to your computer.
4. Connect an Arduino board to your computer via the serial port.
5. Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the project to the Arduino board.
6. Run the Python script to launch the application.
7. Adjust the parameters and observe the real-time image processing results on the user interface.
8. Observe the synchronized LED control based on the processed video frames through the Arduino.
